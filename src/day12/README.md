# First-in, First out Animal Shelter
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:

- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.
#### Stretch Goal
If a cat or dog isn’t preferred, return whichever animal has been waiting in the shelter the longest.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
