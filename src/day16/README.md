# Fizz Buzz Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.
### Structure and Testing
Testing was not required for this whiteboard since it was originally entered as an "Interview Whiteboard" but I completed tests to make sure the outcome was as expected.
