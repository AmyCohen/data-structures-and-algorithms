# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

- Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only imput. 
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. 
- You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
