# Determine if two Binary Trees are identical
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Determine if two Binary Trees have identical structures

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

- Create a new method on your BinaryTree class called isIdentical that accepts a reference to another BinaryTree
- Return true if the two trees have an identical structure.
- You may assume each BinaryTree only stores data of type int and is not generic.

Trees are considered identical if nodes are in the same positions, and data values are identical. You should be able to traverse the two trees stepping left and right simultaneously, having the same data value along the way without any problems. If one tree ever has a node where the other tree does not or one node has data not matching the other tree then you know the trees are not identical.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
