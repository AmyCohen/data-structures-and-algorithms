# Adjacent Product
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Largest product of 2 adjacent values in a 2D array

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Features and Tasks
- Write a function called LargestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array.
- Adjacent values might be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
