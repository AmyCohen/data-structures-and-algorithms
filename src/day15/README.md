# Max Value in Stack
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find a stack's maximum value

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

- Write a class called "MaxStack" that extends "Stack" 
- Add a new max method that should return the highest value stored in the stack.

Make sure your max method works even when the stack has been updated (ie, a new maximum may have been pushed or the current maximum may have been popped).  Hint: these scenarios are good test cases!

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
