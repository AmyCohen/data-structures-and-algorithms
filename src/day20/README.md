# Flip A Binary Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Flip a Binary Tree so all itâ€™s left and right nodes are swapped.

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

Traverse through a binary tree and swap each right and left value.

**Hint:** consider this incomplete pseudocode:

recurse(node):
  - newLeft = recurse(node.right)
  - node.right = recurse(node.left)
  - node.left = newLeft
  - return node

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
