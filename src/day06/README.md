# Linked List Insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Linked list insertions

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Features and Tasks
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
- .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.


### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
