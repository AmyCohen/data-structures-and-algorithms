# Intersection of Binary Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
