# Mergesort
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Mergesort

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks

Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
