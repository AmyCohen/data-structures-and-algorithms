# Make a Queue Out Of Two Stacks
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge

### Feature Tasks
Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.

You have access to 2 Stack instances with push and pop methods.

### Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
