# Array shift
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Insert and shift middle index of array

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition. You may round up in the event that the array has an odd number of indexes.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
