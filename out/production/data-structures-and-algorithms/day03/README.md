# Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition. You may round up in the event that the array has an odd number of indexes.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
